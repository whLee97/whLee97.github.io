I am an Assistant Professor at the Center for Forecasting Science (CEFS), Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science (AMSS), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).  I received my Ph.D. in Statistics from the University of Science and Technology of China, under the supervision of Professor Xinyu Zhang and Professor Zemin Zheng.  I obtained my B.S. degree in Statistics from Wuhan University.
